What has long been viewed as a gala to kick off the Alderwood holiday season, the Alderwood Community Hospital Auxiliary's ninth annual Festival of Trees will be held Friday, Nov. 19.   The organizers of this year's event are again planning to offer Alderwoodrs an opportunity to break out their holiday party clothes and enjoy an evening viewing beautifully decorated Christmas-themed trees designed especially for the occasion.   Held at the Alderwood Mini Mall, this year's event begins at 6:30 p.m. The three-hour social allows party-goers to support medical scholarships, while gathering festive holiday decorating ideas.   This year, 15 ornate festooned trees will fill the Mini Mall hallways, while party-goers socialize and enjoy hor'd oeuvres and wine.   The cost for the evening is $15 per person and tickets are available at the door, according to Charlene Maling, president of the hospital auxiliary.   She said proceeds from the event, which will include a holiday raffle, will benefit the auxiliary's medical scholarship program and hospital's equipment fund.   "This year we are inviting local Red Hat Society members to include us in their schedule of holiday activities," said Maling.   The trees will be on display for several days at the Mini Mall before being removed for display at area businesses and homes during the holiday season.   "We invite everyone to join us in the unveiling of this year's Festival of Trees," said Maling.   For more information about the event, call Maling at 837-1620 or co-president Yolle Widdows-Guizar at 837-1601.
