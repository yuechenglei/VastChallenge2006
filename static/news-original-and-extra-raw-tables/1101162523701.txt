A strong defensive showing by the Alderwood High School JV football team propelled the Grizzlies to an 8-6 victory over Ellensburg's junior varsity yesterday.   The win was the Alderwood JV's second of the season.   "It was a good defensive game on our part," said Alderwood JV Coach Saul Martinez. "I can't really single out any one player on defense. It was a great group effort."   Ellensburg opened a 6-0 lead on the JV Grizzlies with a first quarter touchdown. The score remained the same until the second half got underway.   In the third quarter, Alderwood squared the contest at 6-6 on a 64-yard touchdown pass from Jaime Sambrano to Brandon Coleman. He had eight receptions in Monday's game for 125 yards. Sambrano finished the night with 143 aerial yards on 10-of-18 passing.   Later in the third period, Alderwood scored the game winner when defensive end Brandon Esperson sacked Ellensburg's quarterback in the end zone for a 2-point safety.   "Our entire line rushed on the play," said Martinez. "Brandon charged in and got the sack."   Offensively for Alderwood, playing on its home field last night, B.J. Miller led all rushers in the game with 139 yards on 24 carries.   Monday's victory upped the Alderwood JV's record on the year to 2-4-1. The Grizzlies close out the season next Monday at home against Selah's junior varsity.
