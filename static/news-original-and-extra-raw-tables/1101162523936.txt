ELLENSBURG - Getting three touchdowns apiece from Joseph Villanueva and Adrian Cantu, the Alderwood High School freshman football team rolled to a 53-0 victory over Ellensburg's freshmen Monday afternoon.   Alderwood improved to 6-2 on the season with the resounding win.   Cantu scampered 31 yards in the second half on a TD run, and also tossed two touchdown passes earlier in the game-the first a 5-yarder to Frank Salcedo and the second a 66-yarder to Nathan Cornelius. He completed 5-of-8 passes in the game for 120 yards, and Cantu also rushed for 61 yards on three totes.   Villanueva, who led all rushers with 158 yards on 11 carries, had two touchdown runs, the longest a 49-yard burst into the end zone. He also returned an interception 30 yards for a TD.   Alderwood's Jesse Montelongo also inflicted some damage on Ellensburg. He broke off a 42-yard touchdown run in the first quarter and picked up a fumble in the third quarter, returning it 56 yards for a score. Montelongo tallied 51 yards rushing the ball, coming on just three touches.   Jason Martinez also gained 21 rushing yards for Alderwood on three carries.   Alderwood Coach Glenn Braman said his defensive squad only forced Ellensburg into one punting situation all night long.   "They had the ball for a lot of the game," Braman said. "Our defense bent but we didn't break," he said of the shutout.
