GRANDVIEW - The Grandview Police Department is looking for a suspect that attempted a purse snatching this past Wednesday night outside of Eli and Kathy's restaurant at 813 W. Wine Country Rd.   According to Grandview Police Chief Dave Charvet, just before 10 p.m. last night an employee of the restaurant was leaving the business and heading out to her car, which was parked on North Fourth Street. Charvet said the employee had gotten into her car, when a man came running toward her from behind some trees on Davie Road. Charvet said the man, who is described as being about 5'8" tall and was wearing a gray sweatshirt and black ski mask, grabbed the car door, opened it and yelled at the employee.   According to Charvet, the victim ended up outside of her car, and the would-be thief attempted to snatch the employee's purse. When the employee refused to give up her purse, the suspect reportedly hit her on the right side of the head, knocking her down before running away without the purse.   Charvet said the police department is investigating the attempted robbery.
