Sumner resident Robert E. Ford, 38, was arrested Saturday evening after he reportedly attempted to cash a fake Washington State unemployment check at Alderwood's Valley View Market, 107 W. Lincoln Ave.   A store clerk thought the check was fraudulent and called the police, according to Alderwood Police Officer Oliver Hernandez. Officers arrived within minutes and found Ford running from the market through the Apex winery property. He was chased down on foot by two police officers.   Police said the check at first looked to be good, however upon closer examination officers determined the check to be a fake. Ford's identification was also fake, said Hernandez.   Ford was booked into the Alderwood jail on charges of forgery, criminal impersonation and resisting arrest. He is expected to be arraigned in Yakima County Superior Court this week.   Hernandez said store owners should be on the lookout for more fake checks. It is believed that Ford had an accomplice driving a blue 1990s model Windstar van. The van left when officers arrived on scene to apprehend Ford.
