The Prosser High School freshman football team is plenty tough. Just ask the Alderwood frosh squad.   This past Monday, Prosser wore down the Alderwood freshmen enroute to scoring a 28-7 victory. It was the second such win for the Mustangs against Alderwood in the last two weeks.   Alderwood's lone score came in the fourth quarter on a 25-yard TD pass from Adrian Cantu to Nathan Cornelius.   "We were dragging a bit at the end of the game," said Alderwood Coach Glenn Braman. "We weren't as conditioned as Prosser."   Despite sustaining the defeat, which squared the Alderwood freshman team's record at 2-2 on the season, Braman said he is optimistic his club can bounce back against West Valley's freshmen next week.   "The kids realized they needed to be in better condition, and even asked to run more this week in practice so they're in the kind of shape they need to be in," Braman said.   Against Prosser, the Grizzly players had their opportunities to score early on, but were unable to punch the ball into the end zone.   "We had lots of long drives in the game," Braman said. "But we couldn't sustain the drives once we got inside Prosser's 10-yard line.   "In fact, we had three drives that ended on Prosser's 1-yard line," he added.   "Our kids have to learn that the motto is to win every snap. We need 11 guys going hard on every play. We're getting close to that, but we're not quite there yet," Braman said.   Prosser scored two of its touchdowns on passing plays, the other two scores coming on rushing attempts.
