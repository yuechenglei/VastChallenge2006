Date Published to Web: 9/14/2004
Jesse Montelongo touched the ball just four times in last night's freshman football game between Alderwood and Selah. Unbelievably, Montelongo scored all four times.   Montelongo and his teammates went on to thrash the Selah High School freshman grid team, 53-0. Monday evening's victory upped the Grizzly freshman team's record to 2-0 on the season. In the two games the Grizzly freshmen have played this year, they have outscored their opponents by a 98-13 margin.   Montelongo scored the first touchdown of the night when he hauled in a 30-yard pass from Alderwood quarterback Adrian Cantu. Later in the first quarter, Montelongo returned a punt 44 yards into the end zone to increase Alderwood's lead to 12-0. Montelongo also scored a pair of TD's in the final period-the first coming on a 34-yard run and the second on a 73-yard breakaway.   All told last night, Alderwood gained 262 rushing yards. Joseph Villanueva picked up 122 of the yards on 23 carries, and Montelongo tallied 107 yards on the ground on just two totes.   Cantu threw for 88 yards on 5-of-12 passing. He tossed four touchdown passes-two to Frank Salcedo and one each to Montelongo and Nathan Cornelius.   The one other touchdown the Grizzly freshmen scored against Selah came at the end of the fourth quarter. Diego Burgueno scampered 25 yards for the score.   Defensively, Alderwood Coach Glenn Braman said he couldn't have asked for anything more out of his club. Braman credits the defensive line for the shutout, saying "...the defensive line put a lot of pressure on Selah's quarterback, especially defensive end Andrew Rios, who had four or five sacks last night.   "Last night's game will be a good stepping stone for next week's game at Prosser," Braman added.
