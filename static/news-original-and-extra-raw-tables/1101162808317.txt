GRANDVIEW - Two Grandview businesses were busy Tuesday morning repairing broken windows and doors after would-be thieves attempted burglaries in two different parts of town.   Grandview police officers investigated a burglary at Dave's Recycling Center, located in the 800 block of Dykstra Lane, where they found a door had been kicked in to gain entrance into the center's office. The burglary was discovered Tuesday following the Labor Day weekend.   According to the police report, nothing was discovered missing.   Meantime across town, burglars broke a window to gain entry into Highway Tire Store in the 100 block of Wine Country Road.   Taken was an estimated $40 in change, according to the Grandview police report.   Although there were a number of tools visible at the tire shop, only the money was taken, said Grandview Police Chief Dave Charvet.
