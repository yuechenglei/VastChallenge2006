Boosted by a recent $50,000 campaign contribution by Republican boosters, incumbent mayor Rex Luthor looks to have considerable momentum entering into the final weeks of his campaign for re-election.

By comparison, challenger John Torch has raised only $33,000 and spent $10,634.  Since the recent Starbucks scandal, Torch has all but disappeared from the mayor race.

Although no independent campaign committees have registered with city yet this year, it's likely they'll swing into action before the season is finished. League of Women voters president Sally Partridge promises their organization will also mount an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort this fall, targeting everyone from fence sitters to registered homeless.
