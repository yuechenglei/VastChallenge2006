TOPPENISH - Staff, students and friends of Heritage College gathered to celebrate as the four-year institution received its new recognition as a university.   The school, which has been serving the Lower Valley since 1982, has about 800 students attending classes each week.   Students attending the college can study business and accounting, English and humanities, math and computer science, the sciences and education and psychology. Students can also study for Associate of Arts degrees and Master's degrees.   Since the inception of the college, there has been major improvements to the grounds, including the addition of the library and learning center and the student services center. In the future, Heritage, along with the University of Washington, will be adding a business and community training center to the campus.
