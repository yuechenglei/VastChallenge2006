Farm families offered help
Yakima County has been designated as a natural disaster area based on damages and losses caused by adverse weather conditions during Oct. 23, 2003 through Jan. 8, 2004.
Lisa M. Ruff, farm loan manager of the Yakima Farm Service Agency, said that family farmers who suffered losses as a result of the weather during that time frame may qualify for emergency loans. The loans carry a 3.75 percent interest rate and payment terms can extend up to 40 years.
Loan application forms are available at the Farm Service Agency office in Yakima (1606 Perry St., Suite A).

County-wideburn ban in effect
Yakima Regional Clean Air Authority officials have called for a county-wide burn ban.
The reason—smoke from forest fires, high temperatures and stagnant air conditions are impacting the air quality. The Clean Air Authority expects air pollution to continue to build.
County officials said there is no determination on when the air quality will return to a condition where outdoor and agricultural burning will be allowed.
People with lung and breathing problems are cautioned to monitor the air quality when making decisions for outdoor activities.
The burn ban that has been put into effect applies to all otherwise permitted or unpermitted burning. Recreational fires are also banned, although the use of propane or gaseous appliances for cooking is allowed.
