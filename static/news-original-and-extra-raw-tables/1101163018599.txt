Chez Becky is the hot new place to dine in Alderwood.  Conveniently located uptown on Third, Becky Ballenger is looking to delight a broad range of tastes with her menu that features linguine with prosciutto, squash soup, Alaskan salmon, crepe with sauteed mushroom, and be sure not to forget the Triple Chocolate Cake. Here are the results of a small survey of recent patrons:

"Becky’s potato salad!! It is out of this world!" says Mary Stringfold, owner of Mary's Bridal Shoppe (Becky will be offering catering services soon).


"Chef Becky is the best chef in town!!" claims Kellie Calloway, Alderwood resident.


"Chef Becky serves yummy food for everyone - just exactly what you want at the end of a busy day. We look forward to each new dinner - always a treat!" reports the Funk Family of Mabton, who drive to Alderwood weekly for a meal.


"Is she Belgian? She uses a lot of Worcestershire. But I like Worcestershire. I will be back." notes Delwin Sanderson, off to catch a flight to South America for another conference. You won't find this kind of food in Argentina, Delwin!


"Her Middle-Eastern style vegetarian offerings are a great success. Delicious!" adds Julia Christian,  Tour Guide, Central Washington Adventures. Middle Eastern cuisine might be next on your menu, Julia, for your river tours!


"The Meatloaf and the Low Carb Pork Chops with Mustard Cream Sauce are spectacular," offers Charlene Englefellow, Starbucks barista.
