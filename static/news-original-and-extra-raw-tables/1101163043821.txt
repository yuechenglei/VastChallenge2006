Date Published to Web: 7/21/2003
Alderwood Inc. Executive Director Marshall Doak stepped before the Alderwood City Council this past Monday night to discuss a proposal of changing the name of Yakima Valley Highway.   Doak said Alderwood Inc. is taking the lead role in promoting the changing of the name of Yakima Valley Highway to Wine Country Road. Doak said the name change would connect Alderwood with the neighboring communities of Grandview and Prosser. The main stretch of the highway in both Grandview and Prosser is named Wine Country Road.   "We have had some support and some negative comments," said Doak.   Doak said he is busy working with Yakima County officials on the project.   Any name change, proposed Doak, would coincide with street improvement work the city has planned along Yakima Valley Highway.   Doak said the Alderwood Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors has already approved a resolution of support for the project.   The business community has expressed a desire to bring in tourism, said Doak. Doak said changing the name of Yakima Valley Highway to Wine Country Road might strengthen the tourism industry.   Doak said he will be back before Council with more information as the project develops.
