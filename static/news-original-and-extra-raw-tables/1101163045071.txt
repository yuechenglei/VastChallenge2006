Date Published to Web: 7/20/2003
Saturday morning, Gale and Cris Owsley plan to host a community yard sale, hot dog sale and bake sale to help benefit the Shifflett family.   The sale will take place Saturday, July 24, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 905 North Ave., which is located at the corner of Ninth Street and North Avenue across from Alderwood Christian Elementary School.   Cris said she is asking the community to donate items for the yard sale. She said items can be dropped off at the site of the yard sale, which is her home, Thursday and Friday of this week. She noted that items simply have to be clean and pre-priced.   Cris noted that she is hoping to see community members come back to the sales event with their checkbooks in hand, ready to purchase what they can. Cris said she will also be taking credit card donations.   All of the proceeds from the sale will go to benefit the Shifflett family, who lost Ronnie Shifflett in a car, bicyclist crash last Friday night.
