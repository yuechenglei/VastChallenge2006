'Atta boys' all around
 
Date Published to Web: 7/9/2003
The late Ginger Steffen, a long-time editor of the Alderwood Daily News, was fond of handing out praise to hard-working community volunteers which she termed "atta boys!"   She, like we at the Alderwood Daily News, knew that sometimes the behind-the-scenes organizers of the wonderful events which are presented to the public in our community, never received their proper due.   This year, we think she would agree that the organizers of this past weekend's two days of Fourth of July festivities are overwhelmingly deserving of a whole boatload of "atta boys." We believe everyone connected with the events, from those responsible for setting up the soap box derby race course borders to the people picking up garage at Central Park and Clem Senn Football Stadium all need an "atta boys."   So, if you see a member of the Alderwood Parks and Recreation Department, City Council, Young Life, Alderwood Kiwanis Club, Alderwood Lions Club, Sunnyview VFW Post and auxiliaries, Alderwood Chamber of Commerce, Bierlink Construction, Ace Hardware, The Valley's Market, Bob's Drive In, the Alderwood firemen, Rick Bruhn, the Miss Alderwood and Miss Cinco de Mayo courts, Alderwood Christian High School cheerleaders and the Alderwood Christian Reformed Church, please say "thank you" for making this past weekend an old-fashioned, neighborly Independence Day celebration.   And thank you to the community for coming out to support the events and help to contribute toward next year's Fourth of July party.   Atta Boy, Alderwood.   .
