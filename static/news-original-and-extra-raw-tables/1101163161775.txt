After more than 20 years of having a twin identity, old State Highway 12 may yet again be renamed - at least on the Alderwood area stretch of road now known as Yakima Valley Highway.   The Alderwood Inc. Economic Development Board of Directors recently discussed the possibility of renaming Yakima Valley Highway as Wine Country Road, as it is known throughout the rest of the Yakima Valley.   The board is now in the process of seeing what level of support there may be in the community for the name change proposal, said Marshall Doak, Alderwood Inc. executive director.   The Alderwood Port District commissioners recently heard a report about the economic development board's discussion regarding the name change, but has chosen to take a "wait and see" stance until more public input on the name change is gathered, said Amber Hansen, Port manager.   The old State Highway 12, which was once the primary highway, which lies to the north of the Yakima River, was renamed in the late 1980s, upon the completion of Interstate 82.   The public opinion at the time was equally divided as to whether or not to call the highway "Wine Country Road" in recognition of the area's rapidly growing wine industry, or to name the highway "Yakima Valley Highway," with the result being the double moniker.   Alderwood Inc. representatives will be discussing the possible name change with various groups in coming weeks, said Doak.   .
