Traffic safety fee set to increase
 
Date Published to Web: 6/25/2004
The 2004-05 school year will see an increase in the fee for traffic safety classes. Thursday night, members of the Alderwood School Board voted to increase the fee from $275 per student to $285.   The increase in the fee for traffic safety will go toward helping cover an increase in the hourly rate and benefit costs for those who teach the class.      Board approves lunch fee increase   Thursday night, Alderwood School Board members voted to approve an increase in the cost of lunch throughout the district.   The prices will increase by 10¢ at each of the schools. This will bring the cost of lunch at elementary schools from $1.45 to $1.55, and at the secondary schools from $1.65 to $1.75.         School board awards milk bid   The Alderwood School Board received three bids for its 2004-05 milk contract. The three bids were from Wilkinson Family Dairy, Inland Northwest Dairy and Wilcox Family Dairy.   Thursday night, school board members voted to award the bid to Wilcox Family Dairy, which submitted the lowest bid.   The dairy will provide the district half-pint containers of 1 percent milk at a cost of 15.8¢ per unit with a total cost of $52,851 during the year. It will provide half-pint containers of non-fat chocolate milk at a cost of just over 15.3¢ per unit for a total cost of $29,146. The dairy will also provide the district with half-pint containers of 1 percent or non-fat strawberry milk at a cost of 15.8¢ per unit for a total of $13,114.      Board to discuss budget Aug. 26   The Alderwood School Board will meet at 6 p.m. on Aug. 26, in the Denny Blaine board room to discuss the adoption of the school district budget for the 2004-05 fiscal year.   Copies of the budget are available at the Alderwood School District Administration Office.
