GRANDVIEW - Learning what it takes to make the most of a march down a parade route is something band members from throughout the area will be doing as part of the first ever Yakima Valley Band and Cheer Day, which is scheduled to take place Aug. 12, during the Yakima Valley Fair and Rodeo in Grandview.   The event will pair members of area marching bands and cheerleading squads with staff members from the University of Washington. Among those who will be helping lead the event is Dr. Brad McDonald, University of Washington marching band director.   The one-day camp will bring the students together in sectionals to work on performance techniques and later marching techniques, while members of local cheerleading squads come together with the university squad to learn some new moves.   Registration for the camp begins at 7:30 a.m. in the main lobby of Grandview High School, where students will spend the day working together until the community parade that evening. The students will have a chance to showcase what they learned during the day as they march down the parade route as one large musical group. Following the parade the students will gain free admission into the fair, where they will put together a large college-style pep rally.   The cost to take part in the event is $5 per person, which includes a t-shirt, lunch, snacks and admission into the fair. Those individuals interested in taking part can contact Grandview Chamber of Commerce President Jim Herriman at 882-4085.
