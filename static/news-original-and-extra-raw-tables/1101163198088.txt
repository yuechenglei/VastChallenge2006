GRANDVIEW - Later this year work is scheduled to begin on the installation of two traffic signals along Wine Country Road in Grandview. Tuesday morning, Yakima County commissioners approved an agreement with the City of Grandview for certified acceptance services for the two projects.   Grandview City Administrator Jim Sewell explained that since funds from the Transportation Improvement Board are being used to help pay for the signalization projects a certified acceptance agency needs to ensure on behalf of the state that the funds are being used properly. Sewell said this a role the county plays for many smaller communities within its boundaries.   The signalization projects include the replacement of the current signal at the intersection of Wine Country Road and Grandridge Road, and the installation of a new signal at the intersection of Wine Country Road and Elm Street.
