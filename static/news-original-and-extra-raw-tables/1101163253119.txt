Lower Valley 4-Hers spent May 15 taking it back to basics for their first ever 4-H gaming day. Karen Tucker, leader of the Sunny Valley Saddlers 4-H group, said the gaming day brought the kids together to try their hand at western-style riding games.   "They are done really fast on horseback," Tucker explained.   The gaming day offered the club members a chance to participate in seven events, ranging from fitting and showing to Texas barrels.   Tucker said in preparation for gaming day members of Sunny Valley Saddlers brought in an instructor from Wiley City to teach them how to do the different horse-related events. She explained that the 4-H students, who range in age from 12 to 16, were able to learn the basics before they were asked to step into the arena and compete.   "They practiced a lot before that one day," Tucker said.   When it came down to it all of their hard work paid off with some great performances. Tucker said all the members of the Sunny Valley Saddlers took part in the gaming day, with most members participating in each of the seven events.   "Everyone wanted to try something different," she said.   Taking first place in the fitting and showing event was Kimber Tucker for the senior division, Benjamin Tucker took first place in the intermediate division and Stephanie George took first place in the junior division.
