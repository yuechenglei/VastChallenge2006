Date Published to Web: 6/2/2002
Alderwood School District Executive Director of Business Dave Plesha announced at last month's school board meeting plans to rebuild the concession stand at the high school football field.   Plesha said the concession stand was built in the 1970s. Plesha said the concession stand will be brought up today's standards. Part of remodeling will include constructing a new bathroom facility, which is part of the concession stand building.   Plesha said work on the new concession stand is expected to start soon and will be ready for the upcoming football season.
