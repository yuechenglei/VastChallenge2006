The Alderwood Lions Club needs your help to promote freedom's birthday   In order to finance one of the best Fourth of July Fireworks displays in the Yakima Valley, the Alderwood Lions Club is collecting spare change.   Thanks to the help of community volunteer Carol Stone, patriotically decorated donation jars have been set out at Alderwood businesses to collect much needed funds for this year's fireworks display, said Jamie Smart, Alderwood Lions Club president.   "The Alderwood Chamber of Commerce has generously allocated $2,500 for the 2004 display," she said. But more cash is needed.   "Last year's gala cost $4,000 and we are a bit short," she explained. "We have mailed out letters seeking financial support to a number of community groups. We have already received several commitments for funds and several other groups have indicated they will be making donations," she said.   Smart said this year's fireworks display will be held Sunday, July 4, at the Clem Senn Football Field in Alderwood.   In addition to the fireworks display, a barbecue and 21-gun salute will precede the festive light show, she said.   On Saturday, July 3, the Alderwood Parks and Recreation Department will host the much anticipated Come Back to the Country Soapbox Derby on Grant Avenue, with games and food to be featured in Alderwood's Central Park. The weekend celebration will also include the annual "Spirit of Alderwood" Awards ceremony prior to the derby races.   The Alderwood Lions, in cooperation with the Alderwood Chamber of Commerce, Alderwood veterans groups and other service organizations ask that Alderwood residents consider sending a generous donation to the Alderwood Lions, P.O Box 1103, Alderwood, Wa. 98944.   For more information about the fireworks campaign, call Smart at 837-3898 or Greg Schlieve, 882-4498.
