Read-a-thon
The fifth grade students at Chief Kamiakin Elementary School, rooms 302 and 303, would like to thank sponsors for donations during our read-a-thon. The event was a huge success.
More than 50 students sat in the comfortable Wal-Mart patio chairs and read for 2 to 4 hours. Wal-Mart was wonderful. Not only did they donate their location, but also provided us with cookies and cool drinks.
Another special thank you to Mrs. Hicks for supplying us with homemade cookies.
Thank you Alderwood for helping us raise money for our field trip, art projects for our Hillcrest grandparents and the local Relay for Life.
/s/ Mrs. Erika Barrom, Mrs. Amy Peters and students
