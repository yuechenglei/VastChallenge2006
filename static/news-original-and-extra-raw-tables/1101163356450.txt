Gov. Gary Locke joined Mayor Rex Luthor, Dr. Philip Boynton, and the Alderwood City Council in breaking ground for the $25 million Boynton Laboratories facility. More than 200 people attended the event, held on the site of the new building at the Boynton campus in Alderwood. "This remarkable facility is another example of our overall commitment to protect, preserve and restore the safety of our food and the health of Americans across the land," said Governor Locke. "Just imagine what this tremendous new facility will mean for Washington's future. We know the scientific breakthroughs that will be achieved here will further our understanding of fundamentals of biology and help us develop the necessary methods for curing mad cow disease."
