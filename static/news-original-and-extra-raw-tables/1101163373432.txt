Dogs threatening kids on school grounds
 
Date Published to Web: 4/28/2002
A tragedy was averted on school grounds this morning when a pit bull grabbed hold of a Alderwood first grader.   Alderwood Police Officer Chico Rodriguez said the latest dog incident on school grounds resulted in no serious injuries, "...but we've had dog bites before," he said.   This morning, said Rodriguez, the pit bull in question only got ahold of the boys' trousers. "But it could have been worse," said Rodriguez.   "Every day there's dogs out there," Rodriguez continued. "It's a safety issue."   The local police department is asking dog owners to secure their pets, or kennel them, so school-age children are not in danger of being bitten.   The pit bull that nipped at the first grade boy this morning was located and picked up by an animal control officer. Rodriguez said the dog will be taken to Yakima, and its owner must contact the proper authorities to gain its release.
