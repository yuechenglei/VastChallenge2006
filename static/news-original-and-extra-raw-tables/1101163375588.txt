PENDLETON, ORE. - Heidi Southern, a senior at Alderwood High School, toured the back nine of the Pendleton Country Club yesterday with a personal best four-over 41.   Coupled with the 50 she shot on the front side, Southern posted a team low round of 91.   "It was Heidi's best nine-hole score ever," said Alderwood Coach Gary Rohde. "I believe the 91 was also her best 18-hole score."   The Lady Grizzly golf team was one of 17 prep squads competing at Thursday's Pendleton Invitational. Alderwood didn't figure into the team scoring, though, as only three of the four girls on the Lady Grizzly team were able to make the trip to Pendleton.   "If we had had Jensie (Hernandez) there, I think we would have beaten half a dozen of the teams," said Rohde.   As it turned out, Class 4A Richland won the invite team title, posting a tournament low aggregate score of 349. Class 3A Hanford claimed runner-up honors with a 364.   Yesterday's medalist was Kristen Black of Hanford, who hit the clubhouse with a three-over 77.   In carding her lowest nine-hole score ever, Southern knocked down five pars on the back side. Her steady back nine play included a string of three consecutive pars, on the par-5 11th and 12th holes and the par-3 13th.   "Heidi was very consistent on the back side," said Rohde.   Second in for the Lady Grizzlies yesterday was sophomore Megan Downing. She posted a 121 on front and back scores of 64-57. Playing on her 16th birthday, Downing's present came on No. 8, when she parred the par-3, 150-yard hole.   Rounding out the team scoring for Alderwood was freshman Christine Kim, who took a 155 (80-75).   Earlier this week in a Mid-Valley League nine-hole competition against Prosser, the Alderwood girls prevailed by a 246-296 count. The victory boosted the Lady Grizzlies' conference record to 2-1.   Southern, again, had the low round for Alderwood, claiming a 50 on the front nine at Black Rock Creek Golf Course. The Lady Grizzlies also got a 61 from Hernandez, a 64 from Downing and a 71 from Kim. Prosser's low scorer was Annie Lochrie with a 62.   The Alderwood girls squad will play next at Ellensburg against the Bulldogs and the West Valley Rams, on Tuesday, April 27.
