Gina Popovic, B.A., has been hired by Planned Parenthood of Central Washington (CWPPH) as a public policy field organizer to help alert the public to issues surrounding changes in women's health care.   Popovic will be working with groups in the Alderwood, Ellensburg and Yakima clinic areas, according to Erin Fishburn, the director of marketing and development of Planned Parenthood of Central Washington.   "It's essentially a public relations job. I'll be responsible getting our services and our message out to the public," Popovic explained.   "I'll be working to create bridges between different groups in the community. For example, I'll be meeting with Central Washington student groups offering our educators as speakers explaining exactly what Planned Parenthood does," Popovic added.   "She will also be conducting voter registration campaigns at the various sites," said Fishburn.   She said Popovic will also issue information about policy changes that affect women's health care, as well as working with young leaders interested in effecting change.   Fishburn said Popovic has experience as an organizer, having organized the Ellensburg chapter of National Organization for Women. She has been involved in state and local activist activities for more than 10 years.
