Alderwood High School senior R.J. Elizondo has been accepted to play in the All-state football game on Saturday, June 26, in Everett.   Elizondo is the first Alderwood High School football player to be accepted to play in the All-State game since Jimmy Wells in the mid-1990s. Elizondo was a standout for the Grizzly football team as a running back this past season, leading the Grizzlies to the playoffs.   "It is a great opportunity for him," said Alderwood football Coach Mark Marro.
