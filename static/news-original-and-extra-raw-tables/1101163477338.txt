Date Published to Web: 3/25/2004
Registration for the 2004-05 school year will begin Thursday, April 1, at Alderwood High School.   Registration for the next school year will coincide with parent-teacher conferences to be held April 1 and 2, according to school officials.   Registration for seniors, juniors and sophomores will be held in staggered sessions beginning at 7:30 p.m. for the class of 2005. The class of 2006 will register beginning at 9:30 a.m. and the class of 2007 will register from 12:30 to 3 p.m.   "We will be using an arena format, which will allow students to choose the classes, teachers and periods they most prefer," according to Dennis Birr, Alderwood High School principal.   "This format allows students to design a school day schedule that best fits their needs," he explained.   Birr said all staff, administrators and counselors will be available during the registration process to assist students.   He said students received pre-registration materials last week to aid them in pre-determining what classes they will be wanting to take next year.   The AHS freshman class of 2004-05 will register for high school following spring break (April 5-9) at Harrison Middle School.   AHS parent-teacher conferences will be held April 1, from 5 to 8 p.m., and on April 2, from 8 until 11:30 a.m.   Parents interested in learning more about the two events may call the high school at 837-2601.
