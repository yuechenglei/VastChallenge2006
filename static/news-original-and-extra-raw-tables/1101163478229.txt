DSN doinga super job
I really enjoy the Alderwood Daily News. I look forward to each weekday afternoon when my lovely paper girl puts my paper in my screen door handle so I don't have to stoop over to pick it up off my porch. It's not easy to bend over any more.
I enjoy the insert each Friday (American Profile) with a new recipe and interesting reading about various subjects.
I'm informed about things that happen in and about our Valley, good and bad.
Thank you Alderwood Daily News and all the ones who make it possible.
Only one fault, though. Wish the crossword puzzle was a little easier.
All of you are doing a super job!

Support appreciated
To all who attended the Young Life brunch last Saturday, the Young Life Committee would like to thank the community for its support of our recent brunch. Good food and good friends provided an inviting atmosphere for everyone and we were blessed by your attendance.
Special thanks are gratefully extended to Navarro's Community Center for its spacious and comfortable facility, Dennis and Ayner Browning and crew from Prudential Valley Investment Properties for cooking up a storm, the numerous table hosts who filled our tables with family and friends, Sara Cromwell for singing so beautifully and inspiring us all, students speakers Warren Clark, Luke Spilles and Martha Flores for sharing their testimonies, Tina Bosma and crew for gathering awesome silent auction items and Carol Van Slageren for the star-studded decorations.
See you all next year!
/s/ Linda Hughes, Lower Valley Young Life Committee
