YAKIMA - Alderwood High School boys track and field Coach Wally Shearer is rather optimistic about the season following this past Saturday's Cadet Invitational.   The Cadet invite is a non-scoring affair hosted by Eisenhower High School. The meet featured such schools as Wapato, Moses Lake, Thorp, Bickleton and Kittitas.   Shearer said he has 40 boys out for track this spring, 10 more than he had last year, and many of them are participating in the sport for the first time. Shearer said his first time participants showed good marks this past Saturday while his returners are right on target from where they were last year.   "We did well," said Shearer. "It is still early. We have good numbers this year. They are a great bunch of guys to work with."   The top mark on Saturday for the Alderwood boys went to Joe Schwartz. Schwartz took first in the shotput with throw of 44-9-1/2. Shearer said what made Saturday's mark for Schwartz even more notable is that he is nursing an injured shoulder.   "That is a great mark to start out the year with," said Shearer.   Luke Schilperoort had a third place finish in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.8 seconds. Schwartz was fifth in the event with a clocking of 12 seconds flat while Lester Wells took sixth with a time of 12.2. Matt Arevalo was seventh with a time of 12.4 seconds.   Shearer was also impressed with Michael Graham, who nearly hit the marks he had at the end of last season. Graham took fourth in the 110-meter high hurdles with a time of 18.2 seconds. Graham was also fifth in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles, 47.7 seconds. Graham also took seventh in the javelin with a throw of 123-10.   Exchange student Branimir Janjev was another athlete on Saturday that caught Shearer's attention. Janjev took fourth in the triple jump, clearing 26-3. He was also fifth in the long jump with a distance of 16-11.   Jeff Davis also did well in the triple jump, taking sixth with a mark of 36-1-1/4. Shearer said Davis didn't even break a sweat hitting that mark. Davis was also fifth in the 800-meter dash with a time of 2:09.5.   Also placing in the long jump for Alderwood was Jaime Sambrano, who placed sixth with a mark of 16-6-1/2. Cody Heckert was seventh, clearing 16-6.   Heckert also had a top 10 finish in the 800, placing ninth with a time of 2:15.1.   Casey Wells led Alderwood in the discus with a throw of 97-7, placing fourth. Jason Aguirre placed fifth with a throw of 91-3. Hunter Van de Graaf took sixth in the discus, 86-11. Mitch Lathen was eighth for the Grizzlies with a mark of 78-6.   Brendan Scott grabbed seventh in the pole vault, elevating 9-6.   Nick Howat took seventh in the 200-meter dash with a clocking of 26.2 seconds.   Alderwood's 4-X400-meter relay team of Heckert, Scott, Wells and Davis took third with a time of 3:43.4.   The Grizzlies 4X100-meter relay team of Sarmiento, Arevalo, Nick Palomarez and Rudy Martinez was fourth with a clocking of 49.9 seconds.   Alderwood travels to Hanford this Friday.   .
