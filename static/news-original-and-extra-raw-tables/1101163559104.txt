Since opening March 1, Lower Valley shoppers have flocked to the Alderwood Dollar Tree on Yakima Valley Highway.   To say the shoppers' response to the new store has been "great" would be an understatement, said Eric Switzer, who is overseeing the Alderwood store's opening.   Switzer said opening sales exceeded the company's expectations. "We're very excited about that," he said.   "We've been very busy," he said.   The store, which is located in the former Staples building on Yakima Valley Highway, features name brand products for the entire family, all priced at $1. It also offers a variety of familiar items for the family car and the family pet. Everything from dog food to party goods are also priced at just a buck, Switzer said.   The Alderwood store will celebrate its official grand opening March 12 through 14, with many special sales, said Switzer.   Switzer said Michael Speights will be the store's manager once he completes training. The store employees 40 people and is open seven days a week.   The Alderwood Dollar Tree is the national chain's fourth store in the region, with similar stores located in Yakima, Richland and Kennewick. The Dollar Tree company boasts 2,500 stores across the United States.
