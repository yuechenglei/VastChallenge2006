Date Published to Web: 3/4/2002
The purchase of two Toyotas for the Migrant Student Record Systems (MSRS) program is still on hold, according to Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones.   Currently, the purchase of the two vehicles, which was approved by the Alderwood School Board last week, is under review by the state auditor and the Alderwood School District legal council.   "We just today (Wednesday) spent an hour on it with legal counsel," said Bones.   Called into question was the purchase of two Toyotas, although the price of the vehicles were not the lowest bid in the bid process.   The bid from Toyota of Yakima was $20,195 per vehicle. The price quoted to the school district for comparable Fords from Tom Denchel Ford was $14,212 each. Harris Ford of Lynwood submitted a bid for $13,429 for Ford made vehicles.   "There's not going to be any movement on this," said Bones, who anticipates putting a special line item in the March 10 school board meeting to discuss the purchase of the vehicles.   Bones said the school board will have to be updated on the issues, which has the school district purchasing the vehicles on behalf of the MSRS, a grant-funded program.   If a hold had not been placed on the vehicle purchase, the two new vehicles would have been delivered earlier this week.
