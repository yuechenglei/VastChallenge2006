The Grandview High School boys basketball team ended its regular season campaign with stops in two of the toughest places to play in the Mid-Valley League.   Grandview traveled to Ellensburg Friday night, winning 52-42. But, the Greyhounds saw the Mid-Valley League's No. 2 seed slip out of their hands the following night in Selah. The Vikings pounded Grandview in the second half on their way to a 48-34 victory.   The loss by Grandview on Saturday coupled with a win by Hanford on Saturday gave the Greyhounds the No. 4 seed. Hanford lost in overtime to Selah on Friday night. The Falcons and Grandview finished with identical 9-5 league records, but Hanford won both the head-to-head match-ups during the regular season against the Greyhounds, grabbing the No. 3 seed. The Greyhounds ended the regular season 14-6 overall.   Grandview will now host Ellensburg, the league's No. 5 seed, this Wednesday at 7 p.m. in a first-round loser-out game.   "We played really well," said Grandview Coach Scott Parrish of Friday's win over Ellensburg. "We did a nice job of shutting them down."   Parrish said Ellensburg couldn't keep up with the much quicker Greyhounds, which led to a lot of transition baskets.   The Greyhounds built a comfortable 26-19 lead at the half. The key for Grandview in the first half was it was 11-of-14 performance from the free throw line. For the game, Grandview outscored Ellensburg 22 to 9 at the free throw line.   Despite outscoring Grandview 16-15 in the third quarter, the Bulldogs didn't shoot very well from the field for the game, going just 15-of-41. Ellensburg missed a lot of 3-point opportunities in the second half, going 1-of-8 from downtown.   The closest Ellensburg got in the game was 43-41 in the third quarter.   Grandview went on an 11-7 run in the fourth to finish out the game. Parrish said his team did a nice job of getting some easy buckets.   Chris Mejia had another nice outing for the Greyhounds with 15 points. Anthony Andrews had 13.   James Vela led Grandview on the glass with nine rebounds.   Parrish said Ellensburg didn't play badly, the Greyhounds were able to just beat the Bulldogs off the dribble.   "We also played pretty good defense," said Parrish.   Saturday night against Selah was a different story for Grandview, which had just 11 second half points.   "We really struggled in the second half," said Parrish. "We were real tentative."   The game started out promising for Grandview, which went on a 5-0 run at the beginning.   Travis Pendleton, though, fired back for the Vikings, scoring 11 of his 16 points in the first quarter. Selah outscored Grandview 18-10 in the opening period and 13-12 in the second quarter.   Parrish said Selah's defense smothered his players in the second half. Parrish added that the Vikings were all over Mejia and Andrews, who finished with 5 and 11 points, respectively.   "We didn't get the ball inside," said Parrish. "And they (Selah) rebounded well."   Erik Bell's 25 points didn't help the Greyhounds any either.   Parrish said he feels his team will rebound from Saturday's loss. He expects Grandview to do well Wednesday night against Ellensburg.   .
