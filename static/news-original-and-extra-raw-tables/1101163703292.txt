ELLENSBURG - Much like a pioneer farmer's wife was easily able to transform cream into butter, Alderwood Christian High School junior Patrick Elerding churned through the competition this past weekend at the District swim meet.   Elerding earned State meet berths in both events in which he competed at District-the 100-yard butterfly and 100-yard breaststroke. To qualify for State, swimmers had to finish either first or second in the District races.   Despite attending a class B school, Elerding had to compete in the 2A/3A ranks at District because the WIAA does not offer postseason swimming competition at the B level.   Elerding made short work of the competition in both District events he swam.   In the 100-'fly, he bested the next closest finisher by an unheard of near four-second margin. Elerding clocked a time of 53.39 seconds, compared to the runner-up time of 57.37 seconds set by West Valley's Max McGuire.   Elerding blew away the field by an even larger margin in the 100-breast. The Alderwood Christian standout bested West Valley's Sean Bernfeld by 4.93 seconds, clocking a 1:01.34 compared to Bernfeld's time of 1:06.27. Elerding's 1:01.34 clocking was a slight improvement on his season best time.   The Alderwood Christian junior will compete at the State meet on Feb. 20 in Federal Way.      .
