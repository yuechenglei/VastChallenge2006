The Alderwood High School girls bowling team claimed its first "non-loss" decision of the season this past Tuesday afternoon, tying the Pasco Bulldogs, 2-2.   Junior Desiree Pritchett and senior Amber Gonzalez were the catalysts for Alderwood. Pritchett rolled a match best 299 two-game series on efforts of 169-130. Gonzalez added games of 153-127 for a 280 two-game series.   The Lady Grizzlies topped Pasco in the opener, 682-634. Pritchett and Gonzalez's games of 169 and 153, respectively, paced Alderwood to the win. But, the Lady Grizzlies also got worthy efforts from senior Cassie Coder (146) and sophomore Katie Weets (122). Freshman Veronica Uribe rounded out the scoring for Alderwood in the first game with a 92.   Pasco rebounded to win the second contest, 634-600. Freshman Jessica Weise led the Bulldogs to the second game win, rolling a 148. Alderwood's best effort in the second game was a 132, tossed by Weets.   The Lady Grizzlies clinched at least a tie in Tuesday's match, staged at Alderwood's Valley Lanes, by winning the first of two Baker games, 128-127.   The Baker format calls for each member of the five-girl squad to alternate taking turns throughout the 10 frames.   Pasco rallied in the second Baker contest, winning 142-121, to square the match at 2-2.   In JV action yesterday, Pasco and Alderwood followed the varsity's lead and tied the match at 2-all. The Lady Grizzly JV won the opening game, 555-530, and claimed victory in the second Baker game, 113-110. The Alderwood's JV top bowlers on Tuesday included Josefina Ramirez (122-113) and Cora Rodriguez (111-118).
