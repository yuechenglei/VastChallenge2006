OLYMPIA - Grandview High School sophomore Ashley Lara is serving as a Senate page this week for Sen. Jim Honeyford of Alderwood.   Lara, a 10th grader at Grandview High School, is a member of the marketing club, the Key Club, the International Club and her church's youth group. She is a varsity cheerleader and golfer, and is enrolled in martial arts classes.   However, this week, she is taking time away from her classroom studies and busy schedule to pursue other interests in history and politics.   Lara is one of 23 junior high and high school students serving as Senate pages as part of a week-long program that teaches students about state government.   As a page, she delivers mail, runs errands for senators and she will have the opportunity to present the flag. Pages also go to page school, where they learn about the legislative process and its participants.   "It's giving me experiences that I wouldn't otherwise have," said Lara. "Everyone should do it. It's a great opportunity."   As a sophomore, Lara is considering entering politics and she feels the senate page program is "helping her decide whether [she] want[s] to be a senator."   She said she has liked meeting different people that influence our state, especially Sen. Honeyford, who is sponsoring her as a page this week.   "He is a very nice person that is easy to listen and talk to," Lara said.   "I enjoy meeting with the students participating in the program," Honeyford said. "It's great that such a wonderful opportunity exists for them to take part in."   The senate page program is open to junior high and high school students.
