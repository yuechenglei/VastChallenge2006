   MABTON - Dale Knott of Mabton was getting ready for church Sunday, when a scream from his wife, Becky, sent him running into the couple's living room. There standing on the carpet was a startled young Mule deer.   "The dogs were chasing the deer and it just bolted into the house past Becky," said Knott.   "I didn't know what it was at first," he said. "I thought it was just a big brown dog chasing her (Becky)."   The couple, who live near the Yakima River on Euclid Road, east of Mabton, have seen deer in the area before, but one has never been in the house before, Knott said.   Knott said the animal wasn't scared once she got inside the house, allowing him and his wife to pet her while she camped out in their home.   "She wasn't afraid of us," he said. "Once she got away from the dogs, she settled right down."   The Mabton couple contacted state wildlife agents, who retrieved the young doe later Sunday afternoon. She will have to be rehabilitated to live in the wild, Knott said.   It is against the law to tame wild animals, he said. He said the deer, they temporarily dubbed "Bambi," will have to be checked for diseases before being reintroduced into the area herds.   "It was quite a morning," he added.   .
