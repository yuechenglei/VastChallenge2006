It's not your grandmother's version of the Nutcracker. The Martin School of Dance's version featured some of the classical music from time-honored holiday musical, but with a decidedly jazzed-up twist.   The more than 50 student dancers presented The Nutcracker All Jazzed Up at the Alderwood High School Auditorium this past Saturday night to a near sold-out crowd.   The story of Clara and her magical nutcracker included all the charm of the more famous version of The Nutcracker, with stunning costumes and delightful sets created by Dolores Howe and Kristina Platsman, all under the direction of Linda Martin.
