Wise Words of Weekly Wisdom:

  The name of peace is sweet, and the thing itself is beneficial, but there is a great difference between peace and servitude. Peace is freedom in tranquillity, servitude is the worst of all evils, to be resisted not only by war, but even by death.  Cicero (106 BC - 43 BC)
