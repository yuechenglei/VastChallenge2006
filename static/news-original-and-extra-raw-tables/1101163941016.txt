Wise Words of Weekly Wisdom:

  Death is the enemy. I spent 10 years of my life singlemindedly studying, practicing, fighting hand to hand in close quarters to defeat the enemy, to send him back bloodied and humble and I am not going to roll over and surrender.  Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider, Northern Exposure, First Snow, 1993
