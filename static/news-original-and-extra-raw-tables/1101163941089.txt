Wise Words of Weekly Wisdom:

  I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons or your properties, but and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, I am a mischievous person.  Socrates (469 BC - 399 BC), quoted by Plato, 'The Death of Socrates'
