Wise Words of Weekly Wisdom:

  During the Second World War, the Germans took four years to build the Atlantic Wall. On four beaches it held up the Allies for about an hour; at Omaha it held up the U.S. for less than one day. The Atlantic Wall must therefore be regarded as one of the greatest blunders in military history.  Stephen Ambrose (1936 - 2002), D-Day, page 577
