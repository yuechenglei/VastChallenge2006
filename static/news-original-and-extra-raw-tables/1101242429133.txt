Council to begin collective bargaining process with police guild


Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford informed the City Council Monday night that the Alderwood Police Officers Guild had contacted him to begin contract negotiations for 2005.


Rockford said he wanted to meet with Council in executive session to discuss the initial strategy the city is taking in contract negotiations. Council did meet in executive session on Monday night to discuss the initial strategy the city will be taking in contract negotiations, but released no details.


The city and the police guild are scheduled to hold their first talks on Tuesday, Nov. 16.


Under an ordinance the City Council adopted earlier this year, the city will release all details of collective bargaining sessions with city employees' unions to the public in open session with the exception of the initial strategy discussion.
