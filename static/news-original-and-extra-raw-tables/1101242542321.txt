Long-time Alderwood resident and former Alderwood Mayor Don Hughes is recovering nicely following heart surgery a week ago, according to a family member.
   Hughes was hospitalized while visiting his wife June's Mercer Island relatives, following a heart attack in early September, according to Hughes' sister, Barbara Atherton of Alderwood.
   Hughes is now recovering at a Redmond convalescent center and is expected to return home to Alderwood in the near future, Atherton said.
   She said her brother had been visiting relatives on Mercer Island when he was taken to Overlake Hospital. His surgery was delayed when he became ill with pneumonia.
   "Don underwent bypass surgery a week ago Tuesday," Atherton said. "He is now doing very well," she said.
   People interested in sending cards or notes to Hughes may mail them to June and Don Hughes, care of Vincent Kretz, 3617 74th Ave. S.E. Mercer Island, Wa. 98040.
