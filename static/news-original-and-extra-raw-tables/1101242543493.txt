GRANDVIEW - The Grandview High School Lady Greyhounds did what they had to Thursday night. Now, they find themselves sitting alone at the top of the CWAC standings.
   The Lady 'Hounds walked into the gym at Grandview High School with confidence and walked out with a number one spot in their league. The Grandview team was able to beat Ki-Be in three, winning by scores of 25-15, 25-22, 25-20.
   "It was a good match," said Grandview Coach John LaFever.
   LaFever said his team played well against the Bears, adding that they really kicked up their defense Thursday night.
   He noted that players Angie Cabrera and Tonhya Wysong were really tough defensively against Ki-Be. Wysong ended the night with 41 digs, while Cabrera had 23.
   "They had a good night defensively," LaFever said.
   LaFever added that the team also did a good job of spiking and blocking against Ki-Be.
   LaFever said the Ki-Be team looked good Thursday, adding that they did a lot of things really well.
   "They went to their best players over and over again," LaFever said of Ki-Be.
   Despite its efforts, Ki-Be wasn't able to pull out a single game win against Grandview.
   Helping the Lady 'Hounds push past Ki-Be were freshman Kealey Johnston with 13 digs, 5 kills and 11 service points; Valentina Solis with 7 blocks, 13 kills and 12 service points; Danelle Cowan with 20 digs, 5 blocks and 17 kills; Chante Bottineau with 32 assists and 15 service points; and Mari Cornejo with 7 digs, 5 kills and 2 blocks.
   Grandview (9-0) has won all of its league matches by 3-0 scores this season.
   With only three matches left in the regular season, Grandview will play again next Thursday at East Valley.
