NACHES - The Grandview High School Lady Greyhounds roared into Naches Tuesday night, winning against the Rangers and leaving them looking forward to their next match, which will determine the league champion.
   The Grandview team won against Naches by scores of 25-15, 25-12, 25-7.
   Grandview Coach John LaFever said his team looked pretty good against the Rangers.
   LaFever said the Grandview girls did a good job of getting the ball to the team's big hitters, adding that overall his team played a pretty good game.
   Helping the Lady 'Hounds defeat the Rangers were sophomore Chante Bottineau, who had 25 assists, 11 service points, 1 kill and 4 digs on the night.
   "She played pretty well," LaFever said of Bottineau. "She's running the team real well, and doing a good job serving."

   Thursday night the Lady 'Hounds will come up against Ki-Be in a match that will determine the league champion.
   "Ki-Be will be for the outright league championship," LaFever said, adding that Thursday night's match should be a fun one to watch.
