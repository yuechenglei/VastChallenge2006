GRANDVIEW - The Rolling Hills Chorus of Sweet Adelines International is offering an opportunity to area high school singers to be guests at the Adelines' January 2005 show.
   The show, "Hit Me With the Spotlight," will be held at the Alderwood High School auditorium Jan. 28, 2005.
   The musical, written and directed by chorus members, is about auditions for a "Broadway" musical, which will feature guest high school performers, said Eileen Duncan of the Rolling Hills Chorus.
   The would-be guest performers are now being encouraged to audition for the show, Duncan said.
   Those chosen to perform in the musical are eligible to win a scholarship to further their musical education, Duncan said. A first, second and third place scholarship will be awarded based on the vote of the audience the night of the performance, she explained.
   Auditions for high school singers will be held Saturday, Oct. 16, at the Bethany Presbyterian Church, Second Street and Birch Street in Grandview.
   There is no limit to the number of singers who can audition, however only three will be chosen for performing in the show.
   For information about the auditions call Jean Eakin, 882-3335, or Duncan 882-1420.
