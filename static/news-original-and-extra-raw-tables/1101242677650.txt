GRANDVIEW - Grandview Public Works Director Cus Arteaga Tuesday night requested the Grandview City Council accept the city's new public storm water retention project as complete. The council voted unanimously to accept the project as completed.
   The new storm water retention pond is located on Bethany Road, north of the Wal-Mart distribution center, according to Artega. The pond collects storm water run-off.
   "We'd like to move forward with the project," said Artega.
   With the project marked as completed, the retainage fee of $4,443.89 will be released to Contractors Equipment Maintenance, Inc. once the city engineer is satisfied the closure requirements are made, said Artega.
   When asked how the new storm water pond worked on the downpour last month, Artega said, "I wish we had that in town in a couple of places. It worked really well."
