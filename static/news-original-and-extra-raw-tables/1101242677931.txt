Date Published to Web: 9/9/2004


GRANDVIEW - The Grandview Parks and Recreation program recently received word that it was not only awarded the $3,000 it requested from the Lower Alderwood County Rural Enterprise Community, it was given an extra $2,000.
   The funds will be used to install lighting and electrical upgrades at the new playground at Dykstra Park.
   The REC board awarded $30,000 to the Grandview Parks and Recreation Department earlier this year which, along with private funds and donations, was used to complete the Dykstra Park playground.
   Grandview Parks and Recreation Director Mike Carpenter said that the grant money allows the city to have some seed money to start on the Eastside Park playground program next year.
   With the council's approval, Mayor Mike Bren signed a resolution amending the contract with the REC, allowing for the additional funding.
