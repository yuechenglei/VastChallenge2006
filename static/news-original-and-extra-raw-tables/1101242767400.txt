Are you looking for something to do with your spare time? Consider volunteering as a school crosswalk guard.
   Alderwood School Resource Officer Chico Rodriguez of Harrison Middle School is currently seeking crosswalk volunteers.
   "We need persons with time to devote to the safety of children before and after school," he explained.
   People interested in crosswalk guard positions will be asked to help with morning crosswalk duty, from 7 to 9 a.m., or afternoon duty, from 2 to 3:30 p.m., Rodriguez explained.
   "We have a critical need for such volunteers," he said.
   Rodriguez said the job is ideal for retired or semi-retired persons or anyone with extra time and a desire to help protect the children of the community.
   Those interested are encouraged to call Rodriguez at 837-6211.
