Date Published to Web: 8/5/2004


"The mom in tennis shoes," who went on to represent Washington state in the U.S. Senate, kicks off her re-election campaign today and tomorrow.
   U.S. Sen. Patty Murray is scheduled to travel across the state Thursday and Friday to meet with voters. Her itinerary includes stops in Pasco and Yakima.
   Murray is running for a third term in the U.S. Senate. Her chief rival in the race appears to be GOP candidate George Nethercutt of Spokane.
   The senior campaign officials for Murray said she will speak to voters during her swing through the state this week about the importance of putting Washington state and America first. Stumping as a strong, independent voice for Washington state's needs, Murray is expected to highlight her shared priorities for job creation, education, protecting Americans' quality of life, improving homeland security and taking care of U.S. troops and veterans.
   Murray is scheduled to speak at the Tri-Cities Plumbers and Pipefitters Hall in Pasco (1328 Road 28) Friday morning at 9:30 a.m. Her Yakima stop will be at noon on Friday, at VFW Post #379 on the corner of Walnut and Fifth avenues.
