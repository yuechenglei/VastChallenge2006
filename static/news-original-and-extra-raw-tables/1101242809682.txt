The seven civic-minded candidates who have stepped forward to claim a Alderwood City Council vacancy will have just 10 minutes to impress the Council.
   The procedure for the candidate selection was outlined during last night's regular city council meeting.
   While eight people have submitted applications for the spot left vacant by Councilman Alex de la Cruz last month, only seven met last Friday's deadline, according to Alderwood Mayor Rex Luthor.
   Magali Betker, who last year filed for election to the council, failed to meet Friday's deadline, disqualifying her as a prospective candidate, Luthor said.
   In the meantime, the eligible Council candidates can look forward to meeting with the City Council Monday, Aug. 16, in a special session.
   The candidates' names will be put into a hat and drawn at random for the order of appearance before the Council, Luthor said. Each candidate will then be given 10 minutes to tell the Council why they should be selected to fill the seat vacated by de la Cruz.
   The City Council will then adjourn into an executive session following the candidates' interviews to make their decision, Luthor explained.
   Seeking the seat left vacant by the 22-year old de la Cruz, who has relocated due to his job, are Bruce Epps, Theresa Hancock, Wade Drysdale, Ermenejildo Rodriguez, Raul Martinez, John Panni and Carol Stone.
   The candidate chosen to take the seat on the Council will have to seek election to the office next year to fill out the remainder of de la Cruz's four-year term.
   It is expected that the Council will make its decision that evening, he added.
   If not, the process may begin over, Luthor said.
