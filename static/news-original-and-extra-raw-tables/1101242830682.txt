Chamber's 3-on-3 tournament gains Port support


The Alderwood Summer Jam 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament, set for the weekend of July 24, has received a substantial contribution from the Alderwood Port Commission.


The commissioners voted June 21 to donate $2,000 to the two-day tournament, annually
  
sponsored by the Alderwood Chamber of Commerce.


This is the second year the Port Commission has supported the tourney, which will be held at the Mid Valley Mall parking lot in Alderwood.


 


Vacated house
    
to be moved
   
from Port property


A vacated house on Alderwood Port District property north of Alexander Road will be removed by the Downing Construction Company of Alderwood.


The house, which was vacated last year after being deemed unsafe, will be moved from the North McLean Road site by Darrell Downing's crews. The Alderwood contractor has agreed to fill in the building's basement and level the area, making it suitable for future industrial needs, explained Amber Hansen, Port manager.


Hansen said the Port had originally considered burning it until Downing suggested moving the building.


The McLean property is located on a part of the 38 acres of Port property which Port commissioners hope will soon be annexed into the city limits, Hansen added.
