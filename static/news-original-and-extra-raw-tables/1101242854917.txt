Community center topic of discussion


 


Date Published to Web: 7/14/2003


Antonio Santoy, who represents the City of Alderwood on the board of directors of the Alderwood Community Center, stepped before the Alderwood City Council Monday night.
   Santoy wanted to voice some concerns he had with an article in the Friday, July 9, edition of the Alderwood Daily News regarding issues Council had with the operation of the community center by the Washington State Migrant Council (WSMC). The news article highlighted some concerns Council voiced at its retreat last Thursday about WSMC's management of the city's community center. Some of the concerns included a lack of communication between WSMC and the Council.
   Santoy said the board of directors has met at least four times this year that he knows of, and offered minutes of the meetings to Council for review.
   "We are scheduled for more this year," said Santoy.
   Santoy also said that it was his understanding the only time the board of directors had to come before Council was for an annual financial report. He also invited Council members to attend any of the board meetings.
   Santoy also wanted to make clear to Council the intent of the center's board of directors.
   "We are here for the community," said Santoy. "We are not here for certain entities."
   Mayor Rex Luthor told Santoy that City Manager Tom Rockford is currently reviewing the situation. Luthor asked Santoy to deliver any minutes or other items of interest concerning the community center to Rockford for review.
