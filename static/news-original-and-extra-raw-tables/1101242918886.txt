Full throttle. That's how the Alderwood Sharks summer swim team attacked the visiting Grandview Neptunes last night.
   The defending Mid-Valley Summer Swim League champions throttled Grandview, 551-278. The victory boosted Alderwood's record to 3-1 on the season.
   The Sharks were firing on all cylinders Thursday evening. They won 48 races to just 26 wins garnered by Grandview. Alderwood also managed to outscore the Neptunes by a 144-84 margin in second place points, collecting 36 runner-up finishes in the individual races to only 21 second place finishes by Grandview.
   Alderwood's girls were especially formidable last night. They won 33 of the 37 girls races.
   Katie Knee and Toni Castillo made the biggest splashes for the Sharks. Knee won all five of the girls 14&U individual races. She also was on both girls 14&U winning relay teams. Castillo pulled the same trick in the girls 10&U events.
   Alderwood's Kathleen Dolan turned in a super effort, as well. She won four of the five girls 12&U individual races, and sparked her club to two relay victories, too. Preventing Dolan from getting the sweep was Grandview's Kinzi Poteet, who claimed top honors in the 50-meter breaststroke. Poteet edged Dolan by 19 one-hundredth's of a second.
   Girls 8&U swimmers Sydnee Hernandez and Brittany Broersma collected all the first place points for Alderwood in that age division. Hernandez was a three-time winner, with Broersma taking the 50-meter breaststroke.
   The Sharks' girls 18&U competitors also didn't allow Grandview to pick up a single win. Laura Matson and Rebecca Razey each nabbed two individual victories, with Alderwood teammate Emily Kresse grabbing the other. Alderwood also won both of the relay events in that age division.
   The only age grouping on the girls side that Grandview dominated was at 16&U. Allison Grow was a three-time winner for the Neptunes. Alderwood's Rachelle Durfey got the two other individual wins.
   As much as the Sharks dominated last night, Grandview didn't let the evening go by without showing it had several quality swimmers of its own.
   The Neptunes' Jared Churchill was a one-man wrecking crew at 10&U. Churchill won all five individual races. Alderwood's Cristian Vargas provided Churchill with the biggest challenge, finishing second in four of the five events.
   Grandview also won four of the five boys 12&U individual events. Ryan Contreras was victorious twice, and Grandview teammates Trent Mottice and Ryan Michener each nailed down one victory. Preventing the Neptunes from a sweep was the Sharks' Jacob Hollander, who won the 200-meter individual medley.
   The Neptunes also dominated the boys 14&U and 16&U age divisions. Jase Michener picked up three wins for Grandview, and teammate Matt Concienne got the other two 14&U victories. At 16&U, Jacob Robillard was a four-time winner for the Neptunes. Alderwood's David Knee gained the other 16&U win.
   Tad Tyhuis cleaned up in the boys 8&U events. The Alderwood dynamo won all four races.
   Alderwood, too, looked strong in the boys 18&U races. Kasey Hursh and Nick Howat each won twice, and fellow Shark Kaleb Hursh was a one-time winner.
