Long-time Alderwood businessman Pete Sartin stood before the Alderwood City Council this past Monday night asking for the resignation of one of its members.
   Sartin wanted Councilman John Torch to relinquish his seat following remarks he made at the June 14 meeting about 1960s civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. being an adulterer.
   Sartin said to Council that if he was sitting in Torch' chair he would resign after making such remarks about Dr. King. Torch rebuffed Sartin's request, saying that his claims about King can be substantiated. Torch also added that he didn't leave last week's Council meeting after making the remarks, so why would he resign his position.
   "I refuse to," stated Torch.
   Mayor Rex Luthor then put an end to the discussion, which was taking place right at the end of last night's meeting, calling for Council to adjourn.
