Date Published to Web: 6/10/2003


Local resident Bob Johnson came before the Alderwood City Council this past Monday night to share some concerns he had about people maintaining their yards.
   Johnson said he has noticed several homes and a couple of businesses in the community that have weeds and unkept lawns.
   Johnson said he wasn't sure of the amount of time residents or business owners had to comply after being contacted by Property Maintenance Facilitator Bill Eikenbary before they received a ticket. Johnson said he wants the city to look at some way of speeding up the process between warning people and citing them.
   Mayor Rex Luthor said he would have city staff look into the matter and come back with a report.
