Hand print project to done June 19


Carol Stone will finally see a long-standing community project she has been wanting to undertake come to fruition.


Stone provided Council this past Monday night with a report on her hand print project along the guardrail just outside of Central Park.


Stone said the guardrail is scheduled to be scrapped and pressure washed later this week. The guardrail will then be painted white this coming Monday.


The actual hand print event will take place Saturday, June 19, from 9 to 11 a.m. At that time, members from the community are encouraged to come and place their hand print on the guardrail as a symbol of community unity.
