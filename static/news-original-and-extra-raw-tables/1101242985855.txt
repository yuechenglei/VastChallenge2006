The Alderwood community float, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will be headed to the Moses Lakes community festival Saturday, May 29. The float will appear in the Moses Lake torch light parade beginning at 8:30 p.m., according to a float spokesperson.
   The float has already collected a number of trophies since its debut at the Granger Cherry Festival earlier this month. Most recently the float collected first place honors at the May 15 Spokane Lilac Festival Lighted Parade and the Zillah's Mayor Award at the Zillah Community Days parade.
