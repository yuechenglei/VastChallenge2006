Library says no to Initiative 864


 


Date Published to Web: 5/20/2003


In an effort to prevent further cuts in revenues, the Alderwood Valley Regional Library will host an informational meeting in Alderwood tomorrow (Friday) at noon. The meeting, to be chaired by Monica Weyhe, executive director of the regional library system, will be held at the Alderwood Masonic Hall.
   "We are hoping to educate voters to the devastating impact further tax rollbacks will have on the state's library system," said Kay Saunders, Alderwood public librarian.
   She said people's Initiative 864, being proposed by tax activist Tim Eyman, is being distributed in an effort to collect enough signatures to be placed on the fall ballot.
   "We are asking people to forego signing the initiative petition, in order to keep it from being placed on the ballot," Saunders said.
   She encourages the public to attend Friday's informational meeting.
   "If the measure gets on the ballot, we fear voters will see it as yet another tax saving measure. But the long term impact will be that poor counties, such as Alderwood County, will be losing services.
   "This is not a manner of being thrifty," she said. "It's a manner of closing libraries," she said.
