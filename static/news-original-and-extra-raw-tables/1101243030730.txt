The Alderwood City Council adopted a new resolution banning the repair of vehicles on public property or in public right-of-ways.
   Alderwood City Manager Robert Rockford said he felt comfortable with recommending the Council adopt the new ordinance. But Rockford said he would rather see the city enforce the existing ordinances rather than adopting new ones.
   The new ordinance adopted by Council makes it illegal for residents to conduct any major repairs or change motor vehicle fluids on public streets, sidewalks, rights-of-way and other public property. The reasoning is any such repairs might create a safety or environmental hazard. The ordinance does allow for residents to make emergency repairs to vehicles on public property.
   "It is unfortunate we have to pass these kinds of ordinances," said Mayor Pro-tem George Greenway.
   Greenway said the ordinance is not only for the safety of residents, but it will also help ensure that no environmental contamination takes place. Greenway said the ordinance will help eliminate any possible contamination in the city's drain system. The mayor pro-tem said there are just too many unseen risks with allowing people to repair their vehicles on public rights-of-way. Greenway added this ordinance will also help with the development of properties in town.
