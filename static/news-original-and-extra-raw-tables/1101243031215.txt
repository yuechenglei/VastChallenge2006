GRANDVIEW - There will be a changing of the guard in the Grandview School District.
   Following an executive session last Friday afternoon, the Grandview School Board announced the hiring of current Mabton School District Superintendent Kevin Chase as the new superintendent.
   Chase will replace current Grandview School District Superintendent John Mathis. Mathis has been head of the Grandview School District for the past seven years. Mathis is credited with bringing the Grandview School District into the 21st century. Mathis is also credited with being instrumental in helping pass a bond issue that resulted in the construction of several new, modernized schools in Grandview. Mathis is retiring as Grandview superintendent after 35 years in education.
   Chase beat out two other finalists for the position of Grandview superintendent. In late April, Chase, Mary Walker School District Superintendent Richard Couley and Ellensburg School District Assistant Superintendent Sandra Sheldon went through an extensive interview process, which included meeting with community members.
   Chase will assume the role of Grandview superintendent starting July 1. Chase has been the superintendent of the Mabton School District since 1998. Prior to that, Chase served as the assistant superintendent in Mabton for one year. From 1994 to 1997, Chase was the assistant principal at Alderwood High School. Chase was also a vocational agriculture teacher in Mabton and Granger high schools for several years. Chase received his Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural education from Washington State University. He also obtained his superintendent credentials from WSU. Chase also has a Master's of Education administration degree from Heritage College.
