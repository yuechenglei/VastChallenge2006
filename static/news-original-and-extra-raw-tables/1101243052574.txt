GRANGER - After seeing a levy request fail by just six votes in February, the Granger School District is celebrating in the aftermath of Tuesday's levy election.
   Granger voters passed a $500,000 maintenance and operations levy by a healthy margin of 62.7 percent.
   "It's a happy day in Granger," said Granger School District Superintendent Tim Dunn.
   "We were anxiously waiting for the final tabulation of the votes last night at the courthouse and started celebrating, when the Granger polling places closed, revealing we had the necessary votes," Dunn said this morning.
   The 345 "yes" votes for the M& O levy means the Granger district will see nearly $2.1 million flowing into the school coffers during the next two years, Dunn explained.
   He said the levy approval will be matched by state equalization funds for the tiny school district.
   Dunn said the levy funds will be used to add a new multipurpose/cafeteria to the middle school, purchase a new school bus and will provide funding for additional educational and sports materials.
