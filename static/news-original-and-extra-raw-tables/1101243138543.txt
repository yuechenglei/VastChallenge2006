The Alderwood Board of Adjustment Wednesday night approved the construction of a new home on the corner of Eighth Street and Grant Avenue.
   The stick-built house will be constructed on a vacant lot that is located within the city's B-3, retail core zone.
   According to Interim City Manager Bruce Rinz, using the lot for the construction of a home fits into the neighborhood's use, which is residential.
   Rinz said at the Alderwood Planning Commission level there is talk of changing the B-3 zone to allow residential housing, but as of now a conditional use permit is required in the zoning.
   In the staff report prepared by Rinz, he said expansion of the commercial core into the neighborhood where the home will be located is "doubtful."
   Following staff recommendations, the Board of Adjustment members unanimously voted to approve the construction of the single-family residence.
   As part of the permit, applicant Thomas Flood will have to provide a site plan prior to the start of construction. He will also be required to complete landscaping and property improvements, including replacing the existing sidewalk along Grant Avenue. New curb and gutter will be required of Flood, as will a road patch from the street to the curb and gutter, said Rinz.
   The home will also be required to comply with R-1 zoning setbacks for a corner lot, which is 20-feet from the front yard facing Grant Avenue and Eighth Street. Off-street parking, building height and building code requirements must also be met.
