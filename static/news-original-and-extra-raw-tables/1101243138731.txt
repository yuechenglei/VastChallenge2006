Board of Adjustment grants variance for farm animals


 


Date Published to Web: 4/1/2003


The Alderwood Board of Adjustment granted Eric and Georgia Porter permission Wednesday night to house livestock on pasture located at 626 W. Edison Avenue.
   The conditional use permit was granted for the property, which is located within an R-2, medium density residential zone.
   According to Interim City Manager Bruce Rinz, livestock are allowed as a conditional use in an R-2 zone.
   Rinz said livestock have been allowed to graze the acre parcel in the past on a short-term basis, but the new decision will allow animals to graze there full-time. Property surrounding the Porter's land is currently pasture.
   The field is piped with water from a well, so water will be available for the animals, said Eric Porter.
   The Porters applied for the conditional use permit so they can keep their children's horses, cows and small farm animals they show in livestock shows and fairs close to home.
   In their application, the Porters said they plan to bring in hay and grain for the care and upkeep of the animals when necessary.
   The conditional use permit was approved on a permanent basis as long as the applicant is living at the address.
