The Alderwood City Council approved a set of liquor license renewal requests at this past Monday night's meeting.
   The liquor license renewals were part of the Council consent agenda.
   Councilman John Torch was the lone vote against approval of the consent agenda. Torch didn't make his reasons known for his objection.
   Mayor Rex Luthor removed a consent agenda item concerning a list of payment vouchers in the amount of $415,747. Luthor asked the Council to remove the item because there was only a partial list of vouchers available to Council of the payments actually made. The item will be back before Council at the April 5 meeting.
   Also on the consent agenda was the minutes of the March 15 meeting.
   Liquor license renewals were approved for the following establishments: China Grove, 325 Alderwood Valley Highway; Minit Mart and Smoke Shop, 301 South 13th Street South; Park-N-Pak, 905 Lincoln Avenue; Washington Hills Cellars, 111 East Lincoln Avenue #B; El Mejor Taquetitos, 544 South Sixth Street; Alderwood Chevron, 1805 South First Street.
