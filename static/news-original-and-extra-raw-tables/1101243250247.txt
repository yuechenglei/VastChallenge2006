Council discusses mission statement and priorities


GRANDVIEW - Grandview City Council members took part in their annual retreat last week, taking time to sit together and review the city's mission statement and priorities.


Last night (Tuesday), Council members took time to revisit the work they did during the retreat, looking back over the priorities they had created.


The list of priorities includes everything from continuing aggressive economic development efforts to revising the plan for an aquatic center in Grandview and re-submitting it to voters.


 


Council approves changes to well


GRANDVIEW - Jeff Louman of Huibregtse, Louman Associates, Inc., talked to Council members Tuesday night about changes to the city's well seven project.


Louman said the original plan for the project was to drill a well to replace well seven, which traditionally has high nitrate levels and only pumps at 190 gallons a minute. The water rights for the well is for 325 gallons a minute.


Louman said in drilling the new well a water supply was found with lower nitrate levels. However, the new well only has a pumping capacity of 80 gallons per minute. He also noted that it has been discovered that by raising the pump in the old well, its capacity was increased up to the water rights level of 325 gallons a minute.


Louman suggested to Council that water from the new well be blended with water from the original well to lower nitrate levels and maximize the city's water right.
