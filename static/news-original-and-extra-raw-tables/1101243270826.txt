New legislation would open venues to challenge rules


OLYMPIA - The Washington State Senate voted 48-1 last week in approving Senate Bill 6491, which opens up the state's superior courts in four counties to citizens wishing to challenge government rules and regulations.


"The bill provides a more equal access to justice," said Sen. Pam Roach (R-Auburn), the prime sponsor of the legislation.


"In the past individuals challenging administrative rules could only do so in Thurston County," Roach said. "Many citizens had to travel for hours and at great expense because they were paying for not only their travel, but that of their attorneys.


"When the bill is signed, people in Spokane, Yakima and Bellingham can have access to their local superior courts," Roach said.


She added that Gov. Gary Locke has indicated that he will sign the bill.
