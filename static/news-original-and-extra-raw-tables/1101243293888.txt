In the final count of special levy and bond issue votes, the Alderwood voters gave the Alderwood School District a narrow 60.9 percent approval for its $1l million bond.
   According to the latest ballot numbers released by the Alderwood County Election Department, a total of 1,396 "yes" ballots were cast while 821 voters said "no" to the bond issue.
   Early numbers showed the measure with a higher approval rate, but the final count of ballots added a few more "no" votes to narrow the approval margin.
   All special levy measures required a 60 percent super majority for passage.
   Wednesday's count of the remaining absentee ballots gave Alderwood School District's four-year $1.4 million maintenance and operation levy measure an additional 20 "yes" votes. The measure received a total of 1,480 "yes" votes, for a 64.6 percent approval rate. A total of 787 voters said "no" to the levy.
   The Granger School District's $515,793 special maintenance and operation levy has failed to gain the necessary votes for a 60 percent super majority in the final examination of absentee ballots.
   The small community's M&O measure only received a 59.09 percent approval.
   Meanwhile, Mabton School District's $195,000 special levy gained 40 more votes for a total of 241 "yes" votes and four new "no" votes for a total of 57 negative ballots. The measure, which received 75 percent approval from the Mabton voters on election night, passed with an 80.87 percent approval rate.
