Councilwoman wants to change way city implements ordinances


Alderwood City Councilwoman Jennie Angel brought up the issue this past Monday night of changing the way the city deals with businesses when implementing new ordinances.


Angel had brought up the issue of the city contacting businesses directly before implementing any new ordinances during a discussion that resulted in the passage of a new graffiti ordinance banning the sale of such material to anyone under 21. Angel felt Council or city staff should check and see what kind of effect new ordinances would have on businesses and gain their input before passing any such ordinances. Angel said she also expressed similar concerning dealing with mobile vending and landscaping ordinances. Angel said she wants to have letters sent directly to business owners instead of relying just solely on newspaper articles to get the word out to business owners telling them of any new ordinances.


"It values the business owners," said Angel. "I think we need to talk about the process."
