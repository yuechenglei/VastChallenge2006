Alderwood School District's bond and special levy measures, which achieved an easy 60-plus percent approval on election night, gained more "yes votes during the count of late arriving absentee ballots Thursday afternoon.
   The Alderwood School District's four-year $1.4 million maintenance and operation levy gained 208 more "yes" votes, upping the approval rating to 65 percent. The levy issue received 1,252 "yes" votes and only 662 "no" votes on election night.
   The district's $11 million bond measure gained an additional 186 "yes" votes when absentee ballots were counted Thursday. The measure now has 1,376 "yes" votes to 817 "no" votes.
   Mabton School District's $195,000 M&O levy also gained support yesterday. The measure, which received a healthy 80 percent approval on Tuesday night, gained 20 more "yes" votes during Thursday's count.
   The Mabton measure received 221 "yes" votes and only 53 "no" votes on election night.
   While the voters in the Granger School District seemed bent on approving their $515,793 special levy, it has failed to gain the necessary votes for a 60 percent super majority.
   As of Thursday afternoon, the Granger M&O measure only had a 59.09 percent approval.
   The Alderwood County Election Department's count of absentee ballots was delayed somewhat Thursday, when the department's computer system failed. The election department was back on line by 6 p.m. issuing the most current levy results.
