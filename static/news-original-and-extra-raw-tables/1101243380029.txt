MABTON - If Mabton City Councilman Ernesto Armendariz has his way, Mabton residents will have the option of building six-foot tall fences in their front yards.
   Currently, Mabton residents are restricted to installing four-foot fences in their front yards with options for taller fences in side and back yards.
   Even though the Mabton City Council, meeting Tuesday night, tabled the proposed fencing ordinance change, Armendariz thinks its time to change the height requirement.
   "It's a matter of security," said the councilman, who four years ago was forced to lower his own six-foot fence because of the town's ordinance.
   However, Councilman John Reynolds feels lower fences in the front yard help police and other emergency workers in their jobs.
   "Higher fences will slow them down in getting to the scenes of fires or other emergencies," he said.
   "I don't think we should change the ordinance," Reynolds said.
   The Council agreed to take home the ordinance to review. They will discuss it again at the Feb. 10 meeting, said Mayor David Conradt.
