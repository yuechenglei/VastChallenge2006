Councilman wants youths to attend weekly meetings


 


Date Published to Web: 1/28/2002


Borrowing an idea from the neighboring Grandview City Council, Alderwood City Councilman Alex de la Cruz this past Monday night suggested forming a program that involves youths more with the weekly meetings.
   de la Cruz wants to have different youths from the community on hand at each Council meeting to conduct the Pledge of Allegiance. He suggests that a photograph then be taken of the youths, accompanied by Mayor Rex Luthor or one of the other Council members.
   "I think it is a great opportunity to get youths involved with the Council," said de la Cruz.
   The suggestion by de la Cruz received the enthusiastic support of the Council.
   de la Cruz will be working on implementing his proposal within the next few meetings.
