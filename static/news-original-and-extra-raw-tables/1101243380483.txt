MABTON - Three Alberta city mayors will be making a stop in Mabton next week as part of a Central Washington tour. The mayors are on a goodwill tour, said Mabton Mayor David Conradt.
   The tour was set up following the Dec. 23 discovery of a case of BSE on a local dairy in the small community.
   Conradt said he had been contacted last week by the northern delegation, who last year also suffered international scrutiny when a case of the fatal cattle disease was discovered in their providence.
   Conradt said the mayors will be making similar visits in Yakima, Alderwood and Grandview on Wednesday, Feb. 4.
   "They will be in Mabton at city hall at 5:30 p.m.," Conradt said.
