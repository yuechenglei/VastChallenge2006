Date Published to Web: 1/26/2002


The USDA has announced that yet another cow that was imported into the United States from Canada along with the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) infected cow that started the United States mad cow disease scare just days before Christmas has been located.
   The animal was located at a facility in Moxee. The operation is now under a state hold order, prohibiting the movement of specific cows believed to be associated with the BSE infected cow. Once it is determined that an animal is not potentially infected the hold order is removed from that specific animal.
   A total of 27 cows of the 80 animals imported along with the BSE infected cow have been located. A total of 170 animals from the Mabton and Alderwood dairies, where the BSE infected cows were milked, and a Mattawa dairy finishing facility have been destroyed and tested for mad cow disease. Test results have been negative.
   A total of 10 cows at the Mabton dairy were imported with the infected cow. Three cows at the Mattawa facility have been traced to the Canadian herd that was imported with the infected cow. Others in the Canadian herd that were imported into the U.S. have been discoverd-one in Quincy, one in Moxee, three in Burley, Idaho and three in Tenino. Six cows from the original 81 have also been located in Connell.
   Another 17 cows with ties to the infected cow are also being sought. One of the animals was located in Oregon.
