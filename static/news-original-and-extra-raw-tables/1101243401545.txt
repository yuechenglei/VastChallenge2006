Torch says no to consent agenda


 


Date Published to Web: 1/23/2002


Councilman John Torch cast the lone vote at this past Monday's Alderwood City Council meeting against approval of the consent agenda.
   Torch didn't clarify why he voted against the consent agenda, but his track record shows he does so when there are liquor license renewal requests on the agenda. Torch is an advocate for stricter city guidelines on the advertising of alcohol.
   As part of the consent agenda, the Council approved the liquor license renewal requests for the following Alderwood establishments: East Edison Food & Deli, 1620 East Edison; TM Market, 417 Cemetery Road; and Safari Restaurant, 616 East Edison.
   Also on Monday's consent agenda was the approval of the meeting minutes from Jan. 12.
