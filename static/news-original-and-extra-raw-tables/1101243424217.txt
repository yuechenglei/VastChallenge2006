Date Published to Web: 1/19/2002


The United States Department of Agriculture has euthanized 119 of the 129 cows from the Mabton and Alderwood dairies where the first cases of a cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy were found. Of the 119 animals, 28 of the tests for BSE, or mad cow disease, have been completed and all of the tests have come back negative.
   Last week, an additional cattle facility in Connell was quarantined after it was found that five of the 80 cows imported from Canada along with the BSE infected cow were located at the facility.
   A state hold order is also on a Quincy dairy. An additional three of 17 heifers dispersed from the Canadian farm where the Mabton and Alderwood BSE cows originated were found at the Quincy dairy, according to officials. The 17 cows were not part of the 81 cows that were imported into the United States in Aug. 2001 along with the BSE infected cows.
   Also put under a state hold order is a Mattawa dairy finishing facility, where three cows imported from Canada are located. The three cows at the Mattawa facility will be killed in the near future, according to USDA officials.
