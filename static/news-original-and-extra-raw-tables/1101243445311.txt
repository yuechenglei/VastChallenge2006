The Alderwood School District bond and levy election, set to face voters Feb. 3, was the topic of conversation Wednesday morning as Executive Director of Finance Dave Plesha talked to members of the Alderwood Daybreak Rotary Club about the coming election. The school district's chief finance officer outlined the costs of the bond and levy, as well as what the two ballot issues will mean for the district.
   In February, or as early as this week when absentee ballots are sent out, residents of the Alderwood School District will be asked to approve both an $11 million bond and a $1.4 million special levy.
   "We have two issues that need a yes vote," Plesha said.
   According to Plesha, residents of the Alderwood School District are currently paying $1.41 per $1,000 of assessed property value for the current bond and levy. The special levy being submitted for voter approval will go into effect in 2005 and will replace the $1,246,000 special levy that was approved by voters in 2000.
   If both the bond and levy are approved by voters, school district residents will see a tax increase of 20¢ per $1,000 of assessed property value. This means the tax rate will go from $1.41 per $1,000 of assessed property value to $1.61 per $1,000 of assessed property value, Plesha explained.
   "For the little expense we really get a lot," Plesha said.
   He said the reason for the small increase is that although the school district will be asking for a new bond and a replacement levy, it will continue to only collect taxes on the levy while using excess general fund revenue to pay for the bond.
