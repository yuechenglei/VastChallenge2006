MABTON - An "eat beef" rally aimed at counteracting consumers' fears of becoming infected with mad cow disease will be held in Mabton Saturday, Jan. 10, at noon.
   Sponsored by Clear Channel Radio of Yakima and the Yakima and Benton County cattlemen's groups, the event has been organized in light of the mad cow discovery in the last few weeks in the small farming community, according to Delynn Otis, a spokesperson for the radio station.
   Otis said the beef barbecue luncheon and rally will be held at Artz-Fox Elementary School beginning at noon.
   Hoping to eliminate the current fears surrounding beef consumption, Otis said the rally will offer factual information about the safety of beef consumption. "With proper education these fears can be put to rest and the beef industry can continue to produce quality beef products as they have done for many years," she said.
   Otis said a Alderwood County Health Department inspector and a communicable disease team member will also be on hand to provide information on mad cow disease.
   Helping to organize the Saturday event are the Alderwood County Cattleman's Association, Benton County Cattleman's Association, Toppenish Livestock Commission, Alderwood County Health Department, City of Mabton, Mabton School District, the Van de Graaf, Lommers and Kallenberger families, as well as Ray's Meats of Yakima, Jerry's Valley Meats of Alderwood, Coca-Cola Company and M&M Catering.
   "There is no charge to attend the barbecue," Otis said.
