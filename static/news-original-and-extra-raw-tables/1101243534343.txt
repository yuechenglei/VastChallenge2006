The first confirmed case of BSE is identified in the 
United Kingdom

The United States Department of Agriculture bans the importation of ruminant animals from countries with confirmed BSE cases.


May 1990


United Kingdom
 scientist Professor Richard Lacey calls for the slaughter of all BSE infected herds in the 
United Kingdom
. During the same period, the British agricultural minister declares that all beef products are completely safe to eat, even appearing on television in a commercial with his 4-year-old daughter eating a hamburger. 
 


June 1990


Out of 10 million cattle in 
Great Britain
, more than 14,000 are confirmed to have BSE.

The United States Mad Cow Disease Surveillance Program expands to include examination of brain tissue from downed cows.


January 1993


The BSE epidemic reaches epic proportions in the 
United Kingdom
. Mad cow disease at its peak during this period reached 1,000 new cases each week. 
United Kingdom
 officials brought that figure down to about 300 reported BSE cases by 1996.


1986-1996
—More


than 155,000 cases of BSE are identified in the

United Kingdom
 peaks between 1992-93 with a reported 100,000 confirmed cases.

Stephen Churchill, 19, is the first known human death from BSE. Three more 
United Kingdom
 residents die that year from the disease.

United Kingdom
, who also tests positive for the disease.

Great Britain
 in 1987.

December 2002


United States government officials test tissue from a Mabton Holstein dairy cow and an Alderwood cow in Iowa after the downed animals are identified with potentially having BSE at a rendering plant. The tissue is tested for mad cow disease. The results of the tissue test sampling in Iowa prompts the samples to be sent to the United Kingdom for BSE confirmation.

Dec. 25, 2002


A British laboratory confirms that the Mabton Holstein suspected of contracting BSE is infected with the deadly disease.
