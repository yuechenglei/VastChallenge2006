Daddy, even though Im too little to express myself with words and my thoughts remain unspoken, I want you to know that I love when you look at me, talk to me, and most of all when you play with me. When I look back at you and smile, thats my way of letting you know that you make me happy and I love you very much. Being your daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me! I love You Paw Paw, MacKenzie.
